Today class is more working samples based on last class if and for statements which we have discussed. We have discussed how to approach a problem and convert in to working program.
Taking input from user
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("first number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int firstNumber = scanner.nextInt();
		
		System.out.print("second number:");
		int secondNumber = scanner.nextInt();
	}
}

In above we are declaring variable scanner of type Scanner ( we will learn in future about these data types). From variable scanner you can call method nextInt() to get user input. Don't worry about these lines as we will learn what exactly they mean in future classes.
Steps involved in writing program
Step 1
Understand what the program is supposed to do. This is very important and called requirements in real software. Have a mental picture how the working program will look like even if you have no idea how you are going to write it.
For example when we discussed about the program to find out minimum and maximum numbers given 2 numbers, need to think of the working program will have
A program called MinMaxSample exists
When we run this program it will ask 

First number:
Second number:
prints as
minimum number is:
maximum number is:

Step 2
Forget about the program and how you are going to do solve this.Think how you solve this on note book. Take some sample data and run through your mind. For example in above case what user inputs 2 numbers as 10, 20, then it should print minimum number is :10 and maximum is 20. If user gives another set like 40, 20, then it should give minimum number as 20 and maximum is 40.
How did you determine which number is minimum and maximum between these 2 numbers. It was not first number always. What you did is, you have asked yourself a question , whether first number is less that second number. If YES then minimum is first number otherwise minimum is second number. Usually the questions like this will become logical conditions like if in programing. you can start typing this in plain English like below
if first number is less than second number then
 
 minimum = first number
    maximum = second number
otherwise
    minimum = second number
    maximum = first number
    
Step 3
Now you can start putting in program. Questions like is will be come if , phrases like otherwise will become else
Write syntax first
   
   if(){

    }else{

    }
As we have learned in last class the if block will take anything yes or no (true/false). you can take your above written sentences and convert in to logic
  
  if( firstNumber < secondNumber){
        System.out.println("Minimum is:" + firstNumber);
        System.out.println("Maximum is:" + secondNumber);
    }else{

        System.out.println("Minimum is:" + secondNumber);
        System.out.println("Maximum is:" + firstNumber);
    }
    
Another conditional program
Do you know what is the value of 5/2? . It can be either 2.5 or 2 based on data types.
	
  int x = 5;
		int y = 2;
		System.out.println(x/y);

		double x1 = 5;
		double y1 = 2;
		System.out.println(x1/y1);
    
x/y will get 2 and x1/y1 will get 2.5
There is another operator % which will get reminder.

5 % 2 = 1
6 % 2 = 0
7 % 2 = 1
8 % 2 = 0

We are going to use this % operator to find out whether number is even or odd
pseudo logic

is number % 2 value is 0 then
     number is even
otherwise 
    number is odd
    import java.util.Scanner;

public class Application {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("give number:");
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		
		// number % 2 is zero it is even
		// else it is odd
		
		if(number %2 == 0) {
			System.out.println(number + " is even");
		}else {
			System.out.println(number + " is odd");
		}

	}
}

Program using for loop
As we have learned and did last class for we did some exercise using for loop.
Requirement
Program should able to take a number from user and should print multiplication table up to 10.
for example if user gives 3 then
    3
    6
    9
    12
    ...
    ...
    30

enhanced form of this program should print in the following format
   3 * 1  = 3
   3 * 2  = 6
   3 * 3  = 9
   3 * 4  = 12
   ...
   ...
   3 * 10  = 30
Pseudo logic
Here we need to print 10 times starting from 1
We can think of something like this
number = user input
starting from 1 to 10
    number * counter
Actual program logic
As we have learned for is the for repetition do first the syntax
    for( ;   ;  ){

    }
If you know in the first part of for is initialization like i=1
Second part is condition where as long as condition evaluates true, then loop run. number <= 10
Third part is increment in this case i=i+1
Next is body of the for ( in between { and } )
With the above thing in mind the final program will be
import java.util.*;

public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("table number:");
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		for(int i=1; i<=10; i++) {
			int answer = number * i;
			System.out.println(answer);
		}
	}
}

Printing the answer along with table number is:
import java.util.*;

public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("table number:");
		int number = scanner.nextInt();
		for(int i=1; i<=10; i++) {
			int answer = number * i;
			System.out.println(number + " *" + " " + i + " = " + " " + answer);
		}
	}
}

Easy Navigation in Eclipse
We have Ctrl Shift F to format and keep using this to indent your code properly.
You can use short keys to do speed up your coding in windows (also in mac).

If you observe above you can see there is underline for each characters in the menu. What is this means if you press Alt key ( for example Alt F will select the File menu)

By typing Alt F and pressing Enter twice you will be in creating new Java project.
Homework
Create session5 notes and check it in notes directory as session5.txt
Create a program which tells the school type based on user entered grade. 
Project name: SchoolTypeApp
Class name: Application.java
Should Ask the user about the grade
Based on user entered 
less than 5 , should print Elementary School
between 6 and 8 should print Middle School
between 9 and 12 should print High School
above 12 should print as College

Create program which will tell how many minutes will take for total runs 
Project name: RunTimeCalculator
Class name: Applcation.java
Ask the user 
Give number of laps run:
for each run 
ask how much time taken
Finally print total time taken for all laps.
Note: Check the home work under HomeWork folder ( change Eclipse workspace to Homework directory for the projects to be created in Homework so that you can check in git using standard git commands)
