We learned git basics and we used github for our java source files and notes.

What we will be using git for…
Git is used by a lot of companies.
We will git for taking notes, exercises, and quizzes.
If you take a break from java you can look into your github account and get to speed quickly
Companies look for your github account while hiring. They will see what you have done.
You can add your github account to your resume.

Process of putting your something in Github…
Create a repository
Copy the url of the repository
Go to command prompt
cd/  (enter)
md gitlearn (enter)
cd gitlearn (enter)
git clone url (enter)

This will bring whatever in on your repository on your computer.


Adding a new file…

Let’s say for examples we are creating session3.txt
Continuation  of  “Process of putting something in Github”
Type session3.txt (enter)
In notepad type in your own notes
Go to file (left corner on notepad) -> save
Quit out from the notepad
Command prompt: type git status (enter) [red=change]
Type git add * (enter)
Type git push origin master (enter)
Now go to your github account and find your new file.

Modifying files…
Open command prompt
cd/
cd gitlearn/basicjava
Notepad session3.txt
Modify with new notes
File -> save
Quit notepad
git status
git add *
git commit -m “some comment”
git push origin master 

Deleting files…
Use del command ( or use file explorer)


Summary
Git status = shows the status of addition/ modifications / deletions
Git add * = adds file to local (account)
Git commit -m “some comment” = commits to local repository
Git push origin master = finally they are in your github account
